    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven
      preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes,
      then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important
      to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before
      you cut into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short
      on time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The
      best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with
      foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's
      heated through and the sauce is bubbly.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
      <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
        heat until well browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season
        with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian
        seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½
        hours, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
        noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
        with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
        tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
        baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping
        slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of
        the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
        and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
        spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for
        an additional 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
